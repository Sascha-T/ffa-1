helpMsg: |-
  FFA's goal is to provide a fully decentralized discord server by allowing the community to control every aspect of the server. The entire system is based around reputation. The most reputable users are the moderators. If you believe a certain user is suitable to moderate, you may enter the following: `{0}rep username#1234`. The opposite can be done with `{0}unrep`.

  It is essential that reputation remains in the right hands, as everything revolves around it. It is your duty as a member of this community to ensure that if a user was unjustly punished, the culprit must pay the consequences while vindicating the victim. You may view anyone's reputation by using `{0}getrep`.

  If you wish to view the various command categories, you may use `{0}modules`. To view all the commands of a module, you may use `{0}module general`. You may also view all commands by using `{0}commands`. If you wish to view the progress of this bot, or simply support the creators, you may join the official FFA server here: {1}.

higherRep: you may not use this command on users with a higher reputation than yourself.
